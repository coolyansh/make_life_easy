This script continuously scrapes the cricbuzz website and alerts you when your favourite batsman comes to bat.

HOW TO USE :

Run the python script(if you have Python installed on your system) or simply download the rar file and run the .exe file(only for Windows). You need to give the url of the match (Cricbuzz site, scorecard version starting with https://www.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scorecard/). Then enter the name of the batsman you want and boom, you will hear the soundtrack of "Last of the Mohicans" when the batsman comes in to bat at the crease.

NOTE: This script was originally written for ODIs and T20s and not Test matches. You might face a problem using this script for Test Matches(especially for 3rd and 4th innings).
