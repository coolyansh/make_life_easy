This script automates my torrent downloads(currently only from YTS) by fetching list of to-download movies from my personalized list at IMDb(https://www.imdb.com/list/ls045429726/) and checking whether download is already in progress(if not, torrent is downloaded and started immediately). If download has finished(completed downloads are moved to a specified folder by BitTorrent) the script removes the movie from the list.

To use this script you must have the necessary python modules installed along with the required version of chromedriver. Change the paths of the folders and the url(IMDb list) used in the script as required. To further reduce the hustle of executing this script everytime, schedule it with Task Scheduler or add it to the list of programs executed at Startup. When you will be done all you need to do is add movies to your list from IMDb and it automatically gets downloaded whenever you computer starts.
