Memory Game Bot uses pyautogui library of Python to automate playing The Memory Game(Link: https://rishavagarwal.me/Memory-Game/ ).

To use the script(currently works with 1366*768 resolution as pyautogui works with pixel locations for mouse clicks, needs to be edited for different resolution), open the memory game from the given link, maximize the browser window and scroll to the bottom of the page so that all the tiles are clearly visible. Then just run the script and watch the bot take over the game and win.
